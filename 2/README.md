# Day 2: **Nim**

## Notes
*Hype!*

I actually wanted to try this cute language since I discovered it.
The Python-like syntax and the fact that it's a compiled language was something interesting.

Just a brute force implementation, pretty straight-forward. Probably could change few lines and it would work on Python3, *goals?*

## Run

Using the `C` backend:
```bash
nim c --run main.nim
```
