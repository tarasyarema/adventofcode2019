# Day 3: **Python**

## Notes
I guess I just burned my Joker card...

Could have solved it in C++ or some other OOP language.
Tried to solve it in Haskell and Perl, *almost died*. 

Naive solution using dicts and string magic with my unwanted baby...

## Run

To run it just `python main.py`, use **python3** you bastard!.
